# SimpleSmartBoardTool
Welcome to the SimpleSmartBoardTool documentation! This tool was created in 2018 for my physics teacher, who found it hard to use the build in tool with smartboard. It offers a minimal interface with just two buttons: CAPTURE and DRAG.

## Buttons

### 1. CAPTURE
-   **Capture** is a handy feature that allows you to take quick screenshots of your smartboard's content.
-   Upon pressing the **CAPTURE** button, SimpleSmartBoardTool takes a screenshot and automatically saves it in the same directory as the tool's executable.
-   The screenshot is then promptly opened in Microsoft Paint for further editing or annotation.

### 2. DRAG
-   **Drag** provides a convenient way to move windows effortlessly.
-   To use the **DRAG** function, simply click and hold your mouse on the button, and the tool will enable window movement.

To close the app, you can use the toolbar icon, right-clicking it will reveal a simple menu with two options: Quit and See Saved Screenshots
